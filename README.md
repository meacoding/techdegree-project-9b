## Technologies and skills used 

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript
+ jQuery
+ Adobe XD 

## Reason for creation
To build a portfolioâ€”the final project of the Treehouse Techdegree FEWD program. 

## What I did
 It's a standard sectional single page website. I prototyped it in Adobe XD. The project information is displayed via modal overlays. The courses are inserted via $.getJSON. The contact form is inserted via iframe to prevent index.html refreshing upon PHP submit. 
 
## Backstory
This is the original version of my portfolio that was submitted as the final project for the Treehouse Techdegree program.

A notable issue I ran into pertains to fixed modal overlays on iOS devices. In modal overlays, you have the ability to scroll the body underneath the modal even though its styling is set to overflow: hidden. This issue does not appear, to the best of my knowledge, on any other device. The long scrolling of the body has mostly been mitigated. The user will only experience this if they are super awkwardly scrolling through the modal like I was trying to "break" it.
